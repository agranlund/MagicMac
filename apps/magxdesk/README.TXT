Instead of being monolithical, it uses various auxiliary programs:

- MGCOPY for file operations
- MGFORMAT for disk operations
- MVGVIEW as text viewer
- MGEDIT as text editor
- MGNOTICE as notice manager
- CHGRES for screen resolution change
- SHUTDOWN for shutdown and reboot
- APPLICAT to manager file types and file icons
- MCMD for command lines
- VT52 for text based programs

There is version 4 and version 5 of this application, version 5 is the lastest one which is also used for MagiC 6 and in all emulators.
The application is localised in German, French and English
