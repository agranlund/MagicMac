Various batch files to be run under MCMD.
They are used to compile and link software written in assembler.

AL_PASM			use pasm and plink (from PureC) and exe2bin
ALP				use mas (from TurboC) and plink
ALT				same, but create .TOS instead of .PRG
AUK				use mas and set country code 3 (UK)
AUSA			use mas and set country code 0
L				link using tlink (from TurboC)

French would be country code 2
German would be country code 1
